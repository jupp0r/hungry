Hungry
=====

A small Web App for all those annoyed with the webpage of Studentenwerk Dresden.
The idea is that all you need to pick the tastiest food for the campus day is one quick
glance.

Installation
========

run

	cake build
	
This should build mensa.js. Open index.html in your browser and enjoy!

Motivation
========

This is a small little project of mine to make myself familiar with html5, async IO and
current state-of-the-art client web technology. The idea is to do everything in the
browser, not rely on server infrastructure and be able to read the whole thing offline.

Tech Stuff
=======

The main part of the project is contained in mensa.coffe

I'm using the following frameworks:
* jquery
* jquery mobile
* jstorage
